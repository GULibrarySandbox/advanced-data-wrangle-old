This online self-paced workshop teaches advanced data wrangling skills including combining datasets, geolocating data, and “what if” exploration using OpenRefine.

Working with data previously cleaned in [Introduction to Data Cleaning with OpenRefine workshop](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/data-cleaning-intro/), learn to:

- extend data with additional variables from other data,
- visualise geographic locations using Geo.json resulting in an interactive map
- create a webpage to display the geographically visualised data using Github.

Download the software and dataset, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. The workshop takes around 2 hours to complete.
