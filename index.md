## Introduction to Data Wrangling with OpenRefine

{% include figure.html img="GC_Campus_LM-3181.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="75%" %}

OpenRefine is an open source tool to explore, clean, organise, combine and transform data. OpenRefine is particularly powerful when working with large datasets. 

Learn basic data cleaning techniques in this self-paced online workshop such as:

- exploring tabular data through facets and filters
- implementing ‘tidy data' principles
- cleaning, organising and preparing data for analysis
- extracting and using a script to automate wrangling on similar data

Download the software and dataset, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. Give yourself around 2 1/2 hours to complete the workshop.
