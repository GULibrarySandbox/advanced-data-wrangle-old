# Advanced Data Wrangling with OpenRefine
A self-paced [online workshop](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/advanced-data-wrangle/) developed by staff at [Griffith University Library](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library).

This online self-paced workshop teaches advanced data wrangling skills including combining datasets, geolocating data, and “what if” exploration using [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/). Prior experience using OpenRefine, or completion of the [Introduction to Data Wrangling with OpenRefine](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/intro-data-wrangle/) workshop is highly recommended. 

Working with data previously cleaned in Introduction to Data wrangling with OpenRefine workshop, learn to:
- extend data with additional variables from other data,
- visualise geographic locations using Geo.json resulting in an interactive map
- create a webpage to display the geographically visualised data using Github.

Download the software and datasets, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. The workshop takes around 2 hours to complete.
